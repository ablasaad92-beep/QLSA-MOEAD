# Scheduling Fast Fourier Transform on 8 hetrogenous computing platform using hybrid metaheuristic and Q-learning Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of the QLSA-MOEAD, GRASP-MOEAD,SA-MOEAD,TS-MOEAD,GSA-MOEAD,GTS-MOEAD and HACG algorithms On FFT  with 8-units and CCR=1 for heterogeneous task scheduling.

## Dataset
For demonstration, one representative workflow case is included in the repository.  
The full dataset for all cases used in the experiments can be provided upon request.

## Usage
- Compile the project using NetBeans or any Java IDE.
- Run the main class to reproduce the scheduling results for the included case.
