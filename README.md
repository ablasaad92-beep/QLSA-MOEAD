# QLSA-MOEAD

This repository contains the implementation of the QLSA-MOEAD algorithm  On FFT  with 3-units and CCR=1 for heterogeneous task scheduling.

## Dataset
For demonstration, one representative workflow case is included in the repository.  
The full dataset for all cases used in the experiments can be provided upon request.

## Usage
- Compile the project using NetBeans or any Java IDE.
- Run the main class to reproduce the scheduling results for the included case.
